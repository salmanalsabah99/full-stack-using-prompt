# 🎙️ Voice-to-Code

**Status:** Done

**Type:** Prompt-to-Code Experiment / Full-Stack via Voice / Cursor Playground  

---

## 🧠 What This Is

This project explores whether a **full-stack app can be built entirely through spoken logic**.

Using ChatGPT's **speech-to-text**, I describe every piece of the app — structure, logic, flow — *out loud*. ChatGPT turns that into a detailed prompt, which is then passed into **Cursor** to generate frontend and backend code.

It’s not casual conversation — I’m speaking in pure dev logic, like:

> “When the TaskBoard loads, fetch all TaskLists from the backend and render each one in a horizontally scrollable column. Add a button to create a new TaskList that sends a POST request and updates the layout immediately.”

This becomes the blueprint. No boilerplate, no typing — just **thought → instruction → implementation**.

---

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

- To **think in logic**, speak in code, and skip the keyboard.
- To treat **prompting as a legitimate engineering skill**.
- To see if **natural speech** improves speed and clarity.
- To explore how far **Cursor + GPT** can go with precise direction.

## 📌 Current Focus: Leo (Second Brain)

Leo isn’t a fixed product. It’s a space to:
- Stay productive 
- Keep things in flow 
- Track thoughts, tasks, and time 
- Evolve based on whatever I need — or feel like experimenting with

Sometimes it’s about refining a feature. 
Other times it’s about testing strange combinations, mixing concepts, and seeing what happens.

The backend is still changing — I’m tweaking functionality, debugging as I go, and refining the logic one step at a time.

There’s no roadmap — just exploration, iteration, and fun.

Eventually, Leo will include an AI component — but what it *does* will depend entirely on the structure and data we build along the way.

## 🔁 Development Process

All development is **prompt-driven**, from start to finish.

1. I **speak** the full logic — layout, state, backend, interactions.
2. ChatGPT **transcribes and refines** the logic into a clean prompt.
3. I **paste** the prompt into Cursor.
4. Code is **generated**, and I **iterate** only through more spoken logic.

> No manual typing. No boilerplate. No edits unless debugging.

## 🧪 Prompting Styles

We use a structured prompt format in Leo depending on the task type. It blends system design, clean frontend, and robust backend thinking — always with clear logic and good taste.

---

### 1. 🧠 Full-Stack Feature Prompt – Design, Logic, and Debugging  
Use this prompt format when building new features, fixing bugs, or doing anything that spans the full stack.

✅ **Unified Format – Use Every Time:**

1. **Feature Title**  
   *e.g. Feature: Add Event*

2. **Final Goal**  
   What is the high-level purpose of this feature in the Leo app?  
   Why are we building it? How does it help?

3. **Architectural Context**  
   Describe the tech stack (e.g. Next.js, Prisma, MySQL) and how this fits into the existing component structure.  
   Example: `TaskBoard` → `TaskList` → `AddTask`  
   Use clean, Notion-style theming with flexible layouts.

4. **Implementation Philosophy**  
   Think before coding. Choose the right paradigm (OOP, functional, hybrid).  
   Separate concerns clearly: UI logic, state, database logic, effects.  
   Prioritize composability and scalability.

5. **Functional Requirements**  
   Bullet list of exactly what the feature must do:  
   - Render UI element  
   - Handle interactions  
   - Send/receive API data  
   - Validate user input  
   - Show loading/error states

6. **Data Flow Strategy**  
   Define how data moves through the system:  
   → UI → State → Backend → Database → and back again.

7. **Edge Cases and Constraints**  
   Identify all boundary conditions:  
   - What if the user input is empty?  
   - What if the API fails?  
   - What if data is duplicated or stale?

8. **Testing & Debugging Plan**  
   Plan how to test this feature:  
   - Unit tests  
   - Integration tests  
   - Dev-only logs or assertions  
   - Error toasts and fallback behaviors

9. **File Awareness Instructions**  
   Don’t generate blind code. Read the existing files first.  
   Respect the file structure — no duplicates, no bloat.  
   Add logic to the right place.

10. **Output Format**  
    Use Markdown code blocks with the filename shown above the block.  
    Only include changed or new files.  
    Example:  
    **File:** `components/TaskList.tsx`
    ```ts
    // Updated logic here
    ```

11. **Style and UX Notes**  
    Follow the design system:  
    - Notion-style minimalism  
    - Subtle, elegant animations  
    - Glassmorphism or soft UI when relevant  
    - Clear hierarchy, spacing, and white space  
    - Avoid cluttered or overly dark visual themes

12. **Final Reminder**  
    Think holistically across the full stack:  
    - Frontend logic, backend APIs, DB structure, and state flow  
    - Consider multiple architectures before choosing  
    - Make tradeoffs explicit  
    - Prioritize long-term maintainability, clarity, and clean abstraction over fast or dirty solutions

## 🗣️ Final Thought

This project is a simple experiment:

Can we build real software just by speaking it into existence?

So far, the answer feels like yes.
